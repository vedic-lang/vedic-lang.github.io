> **Fun-Fact** : Basically vedic language was not an original idea, credit also partly goes to [Christopher Nolan](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634240/)'s **Interstellar (2014)**, Early in the movie, during the drone scene, our protagonist **Cooper** hacks an Indian drone. If you notice carefully, it has Sanskrit written all over the screen, assuming that Indian surveillance drone was programmed exclusively in Sanskrit. This scene made me question -- Why don't we actually make a programming language in Sanskrit? and here we are :)
